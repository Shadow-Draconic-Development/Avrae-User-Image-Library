<h1>Update Subalias<img align="right" src="../../Data/rubble.png" width="100px"></h1>

Subalias that handles updating images in a user's library.

## Help:
`image update [image name] [new image url]`

This subalias creates/accesses a backup user variable that allows for the user to restore their data if they make a mistake. See restore subalias.

If you have created images with similar names (i.e. Bob1 and Bob2), you will need to use exact wording, otherwise it will throw an error.

If your are having problems displaying your image, verify that the image url ends in a .png, .jpeg, .jpg, etc. that is supported by Discord embeds. I am currently researching what file types are supported, the best thing I can do is the file extensions referenced in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/f2kt5r/guide_file_formats_discord_can_embed/) reddit post.
