<h1>Image Alias<img align="right" src="../Data/main.png" width="100px"></h1>

Image alias that handles viewing images stored via the `add` subalias

## Help:
`image [image name]`

If you have created images with similar names (i.e. Bob1 and Bob2), you will need to use exact wording, otherwise it will throw an error.

If your are having problems displaying your image, verify that the image url ends in a .png, .jpeg, .jpg, etc. that is supported by Discord embeds. I am currently researching what file types are supported, the best thing I can do is the file extensions referenced in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/f2kt5r/guide_file_formats_discord_can_embed/) reddit post.
